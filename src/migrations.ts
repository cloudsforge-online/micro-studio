/**
 * The versioned schema.
 *
 * Rule 7 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: versioned files, run by a one-shot job under an advisory lock,
 * expand/contract only. Nothing here is executed by `index.ts` — `src/migrator.ts` is the only
 * caller, and the service asserts the version rather than reaching it.
 *
 * **Expand/contract is not advice.** A rolling deploy always runs two versions of this service
 * against one schema, so every change is four releases: add a column, deploy code that writes
 * both, backfill, deploy code that reads the new one, then drop the old one. A migration that
 * renames or drops in one step takes the previous replica down with it.
 *
 * **A released migration is immutable.** `@cloudsforge/db` checksums each one and refuses a run
 * where the text changed after it was applied, because two databases would then disagree about
 * what "version 4" means. The fix for a wrong migration is always a new migration.
 *
 * ## The two invariants that live in this file rather than in application code
 *
 * 1. **`credit_accounts_within_cap`.** `spent + reserved <= cap` is a CHECK constraint. The
 *    conditional UPDATE in `credits.ts` is what produces a good error message; this is what makes
 *    the cap true. A spend guard that exists only in application code is a spend guard that one
 *    forgotten code path removes, and the thing on the other side of it is somebody's money.
 *
 * 2. **`assets.generation_job_id` is `on delete restrict`.** Provenance is the reason this service
 *    exists: `asset-forge` writes PNGs into sibling working trees with no record of the model,
 *    prompt, spec or cost that produced them, so a brand kit is not reproducible and a spend is
 *    not attributable. `restrict` means the record of what produced an asset cannot be deleted
 *    while the asset is still there. `cascade` would have quietly reintroduced the defect.

     * Whether an asset's BYTES may be fetched without a token.
     *
     * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     * **THIS EXISTS BECAUSE A BROWSER DOES NOT SEND AN AUTHORIZATION HEADER ON AN `<img>` TAG.**
     *
     * Without it the feature cannot work at all, and the ways around it are all worse. A market
     * listing is public by definition — a buyer who is not the seller has to see the photograph —
     * but the owner-only ACL on `/v1/assets/:id/bytes` means the only principal who can fetch it is
     * the one who uploaded it. An `<img src>` carries cookies at best and never a bearer token, so
     * every listing image would render as a broken icon.
     *
     * The alternatives considered and rejected:
     *
     *   * **Proxy the bytes through `market`.** Two services serving the same image, two ACLs, two
     *     sets of security headers, and the second one is the one that drifts. It also puts user
     *     content back on an app origin, which is the thing serving from studio's own hostname was
     *     meant to avoid.
     *   * **Signed URLs.** A signature is a capability with an expiry, which means a listing image
     *     stops loading when the signature ages out, and a cache cannot hold it. For content that
     *     is deliberately public this is machinery with no benefit.
     *   * **Let studio ask market whether a listing is public.** A media service that has to know
     *     about listings is not a media service.
     *
     * So publication is an explicit, owner-authorised state change on the asset itself. **Private
     * is the default**, in the schema and not merely in the handler, so an asset is never public by
     * having been forgotten about. Making one public is a deliberate act by the person whose bytes
     * they are.
     *
     * A public asset is readable by anyone holding its id, which is a `gen_random_uuid()` — 122
     * bits of unguessable. That is the same exposure as every unlisted URL on the internet and is
     * the intended one: the asset was published.
