/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Plain `node:http`, as the template is, and for the reason the template gives: the parts that
 * matter here — request ids, RED metrics, the child logger, the error shape, the auth-fault
 * mapping — are framework-independent.
 *
 * Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does
 * not pass CI.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **`POST /v1/brand-kits/:id/generate` ANSWERS 202. IT REACHES NO MODEL.**
 *
 * The handler resolves the kit, builds the spec and the prompt, reserves the credit, writes one
 * row and enqueues. A FLUX call takes 20 to 40 seconds, which is longer than a rolling deploy
 * waits and longer than several proxies will hold a connection; doing it inside the request would
 * mean the money leaves and the record of what it bought does not arrive. `mint` records the same
 * decision for the same reason, in stronger terms, at the top of its own server.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The one decision that is easy to get backwards is the auth-fault mapping. A bad token is 401. A
 * verifier that could not reach the JWKS is **503**, never 401 — answering 401 there signs every
 * user in the estate out because identity is having a bad minute.
 *
 * The second is `402`. An account over its credit cap is not a 500 and not a 403: the cap decided,
 * the answer is correct, and the client's remedy is to raise the cap or wait. A 403 would send a
 * user to check their permissions and a 500 would send an engineer to check the logs.
